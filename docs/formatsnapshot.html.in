    <h2><a name="SnapshotAttributes">Snapshot XML</a></h2>

    <p>
      Attributes of libvirt snapshots are stored as child elements of
      the <code>domainsnapshot</code> element.  At snapshot creation
      time, normally only the <code>name</code>
      and <code>description</code> elements are settable; the rest of
      the fields are ignored on creation, and will be filled in by
      libvirt in for informational purposes
      by <code>virDomainSnapshotGetXMLDesc()</code>.  However, when
      redefining a snapshot (<span class="since">since 0.9.5</span>),
      with the <code>VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_REDEFINE</code> flag
      of <code>virDomainSnapshotCreateXML()</code>, all of the XML
      described here is relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Snapshots are maintained in a hierarchy.  A domain can have a
      current snapshot, which is the most recent snapshot compared to
      the current state of the domain (although a domain might have
      snapshots without a current snapshot, if snapshots have been
      deleted in the meantime).  Creating or reverting to a snapshot
      sets that snapshot as current, and the prior current snapshot is
      the parent of the new snapshot.  Branches in the hierarchy can
      be formed by reverting to a snapshot with a child, then creating
      another snapshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top-level <code>domainsnapshot</code> element may contain
      the following elements:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>name</code></dt>
      <dd>The name for this snapshot.  If the name is specified when
        initially creating the snapshot, then the snapshot will have
        that particular name.  If the name is omitted when initially
        creating the snapshot, then libvirt will make up a name for
        the snapshot, based on the time when it was created.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>description</code></dt>
      <dd>A human-readable description of the snapshot.  If the
        description is omitted when initially creating the snapshot,
        then this field will be empty.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>creationTime</code></dt>
      <dd>The time this snapshot was created.  The time is specified
        in seconds since the Epoch, UTC (i.e. Unix time).  Readonly.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>state</code></dt>
      <dd>The state of the domain at the time this snapshot was taken.
        When the domain is reverted to this snapshot, the domain's
        state will default to whatever is in this field.  Readonly.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>parent</code></dt>
      <dd>The parent of this snapshot.  This element contains exactly
        one child element, name.  This specifies the name of the parent
        snapshot of this snapshot, and is used to represent trees of
        snapshots, as described above.  Readonly.
      </dd>
      <dt><code>domain</code></dt>
      <dd>The domain that this snapshot was taken against.  This
      element contains exactly one child element, uuid.  This
      specifies the uuid of the domain that this snapshot was taken
      against.  Readonly.
      </dd>
    </dl>
